Career Trends & Career Change Analysis 📊

This project performs an end-to-end data analysis on a career change dataset to understand key factors influencing career transitions. The goal is to explore trends, uncover insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build machine learning models to predict career change outcomes.


Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw career-related data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns
- Analyze demographic, professional, and skill-related factors
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict career change
- Present insights using clear visualizations and metrics


Dataset

- Name: Career Change Prediction Dataset  
- Source: Public dataset (CSV format)
- Description:
  Contains information related to individuals’ career paths, demographics, experience, skills, and whether they changed careers.

Target Variable:
- Career change status (Yes / No or binary label)


 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key EDA steps performed:

- Checked missing values and data quality
- Analyzed distributions of age, experience, education, and skills
- Studied correlations between features and career change decisions
- Grouped and compared variables using aggregation
- Created visualizations such as:
  - Histograms
  - Bar charts
  - Box plots
  - Correlation heatmaps

Insights Focused On:
- Factors most associated with career change
- Patterns across experience levels and skills
- Trends indicating higher likelihood of transition


Modeling Approach

Machine learning workflow:

1. Feature selection and encoding
2. Train-test split
3. Model training using classification algorithms
4. Model evaluation and comparison

Models Used:
- Logistic Regression  
- (Optional) Decision Tree / Random Forest 


Results & Metrics

Model performance was evaluated using:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

The results demonstrate how structured features can be used to reasonably predict career change outcomes and highlight important influencing factors.
